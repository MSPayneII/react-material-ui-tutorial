## What is this Project:

A hands-on React Notes application provided by the [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) to serve as a Beginner's Guide for incorporating Material UI in React project.

## What the Project does:

Serves as an overview of Material UI and incorporate its components into a notes application. The application allows users to Create, Read, and Delete note cards.

## My reason for choosing this Project:

My goal is to build more CRUD applications faster by utilizing preexisting components instead of building CSS from scratch. Although I love CSS, it can be time-consuming, which isn't helpful on tight deadlines.
